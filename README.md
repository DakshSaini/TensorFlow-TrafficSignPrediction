# About: Program to predict the traffic signs based on the images dataset

## Steps for outputting the prediction:
1. Images are loaded

2. Images are transformed to same size and dimensions
3. Images are transformed to grayscale
4. Categories (Lables with number of images in it) for each type of sign are created

5. Create a neural network 
6. Run the model
7. Evaluate the model based on prediction and accuracy
